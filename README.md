## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Pull the Docker image
docker pull iamanishx/proxy-xd:latest

# Run the proxy (replace with your GraphQL/tRPC endpoint)
docker run -p 8080:8080 \
  -e BACKEND_URL=http://your-api-service:4000/graphql \
  -e LISTEN_ADDR=0.0.0.0:8080 \
  iamanishx/proxy-xd:latest

üîß Configuration
Environment Variable	Description	Default
BACKEND_URL	URL of your API service	Required
LISTEN_ADDR	Address:port the proxy listens on	0.0.0.0:8080
RUST_LOG	Logging level	info
MAX_IDLE_CONNS	Maximum idle connections	1000
MAX_IDLE_CONNS_PER_HOST	Maximum idle connections per host	1000  

üê≥ Docker Compose Example
```
version: '3'
services:
  frontend:
    image: your-frontend-app
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - API_URL=http://proxy:8080

  proxy:
    image: iamanishx/proxy-xd:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - BACKEND_URL=http://api:4000/graphql
      - LISTEN_ADDR=0.0.0.0:8080
      - RUST_LOG=info

  api:
    image: your-api-service
    ports:
      - "4000:4000"
```      
üîç What is a BFF (Backend-for-Frontend)?
A BFF server sits between your frontend application and backend services, providing several advantages over a traditional reverse proxy:

Problems Solved
CORS Issues: Eliminates cross-origin resource sharing problems by having the proxy serve from the same origin as your frontend

API Aggregation: Can combine multiple API calls into a single endpoint (future enhancement)

Protocol Translation: Allows frontend to use simple HTTP while backend might use more complex protocols

Authentication: Can handle auth token management away from frontend code (future enhancement)

Performance: Built in Rust for high throughput (5,000-10,000+ requests/second)

Security: Minimizes attack surface with a tiny Alpine-based container (0 vulnerabilities)

BFF vs Reverse Proxy
While a reverse proxy simply forwards requests to backend services, a BFF is designed specifically to support frontend needs:

Frontend-specific: Tailored to a specific frontend application's requirements
Transformation: Can transform data between frontend and backend formats
Simplification: Hides backend complexity from frontend developers
